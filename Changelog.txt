Initial changes (2017-09-11 by cs4nd13)

Note: this includes a number of performance fixes from
Alexey Makurin, which are in:
https://github.com/amakurin/CarND-Capstone/commit/9809bc60d51c06174f8c8bfe6c40c88ec1c39d50

I'll just mention "Makurin" below

styx/bridge.py:
Check if pose info is identical to previous pose; if it is,
don't send it.  (On my machine, two thirds of the pose locations
sent by the simulator are duplicates of the previous pose, so
filtering out the dups reduces the number of poses sent by
a factor of 3!)
Modify steering, throttle and and brake callbacks so they don't
send error messages if server has not yet been set.

styx/launch/server.launch:
Comment out launch of Udacity simulator, since I launch that 
separately by hand (others may want to comment it back in,
which is fine with me).

styx/server.py:
Makurin performance fix: convert "msgs" from a list (which would
build up a backlog of commands on each topic) to a map
(which retains only the latest command on each topic).

twist_controller/dbw_node.py
Lots of new stuff here.  In some place, I just added logging
statements.  
- In init, set up things that will be used later.  Of note:
I use the provided YawController, but note that I pass it
a steer_ratio 8 times larger than given by Udacity, and I
set max_lat_accel 4 times larger.  The higher max_lat_accel
is needed only if you want to drive at full throttle; if
you use the default value, you won't be able to take sharp
curves at high speed.
- In twist_cmd_cb, take the twist_cmd messages (published by 
waypoint_follower), and extract the yaw information (this 
is waypoint_follower's suggestion of how the yaw should
change in order to follow the waypoints).  Pass the yaw info
through a low-pass filter.  
- In dbw_enabled_cb, set a flag to correspond to the dbw_enabled
status.  It is unclear how this status should be initialized,
since the simulator sends dbw_enabled signals only AFTER the 
simulator is connected, and ONLY WHEN the "Manual" button in the 
simulator is toggled.  When the simulator is first connected,
NO dbw_enabled signal is sent to let us know whether the
simulator is currently in Manual mode or not.
- In current_velocity_cb, calculate some diagnostic info that
is no longer used (so this could probably all be deleted).
- In loop, change the rate from 50 Hz to 10 Hz, per Makurin.
Calculate the steering angle using the provided YawController.
At the moment I use a hard-wired throttle value rather than
controlling the speed correctly; on my machine, a throttle
of 0.5 gives a speed of approx 40 mph.

twist_controller/launch/dbw_sim.launch:
Set output mode to "screen".  This will allow loginfo messages
to be printed to the screen at runtime (Udacity docs claim that
loginfo messages will also be printed to the screen in "log"
mode, but this is not correct).

waypoint_follower/src/pure_pursuit.cpp:
Performance changes suggested by Makurin

waypoint_loader/launch/waypoint_loader.launch
Set output to "screen" mode.  Also, add a parameter,
"yaw_is_in_degrees".  I notice that the provided data file
(wp_yaw_const.txt) gives yaw values in degrees (you can tell
because they are in the range 0 to 360).  But all the code
provided by Udacity assumes that the yaws in this file are 
given in radians.  This parameter will be used to notify
waypoint_loader.py that it needs to do a degrees-to-radians
conversion.  Long after making this fix, I did some tests and
discovered that it doesn't really matter if the yaws are incorrect,
in terms of how the system performs.  

waypoint_loader/waypoint_loader.py:
Check and use yaw_is_in_degrees parameter.  Remove unneeded call 
to rospy.spin.  Make performance fix suggested by Makurin:
change publication rate from 40 Hz to 1 Hz.  In fact, the waypoints
only need to be published once; no need to keep sending the same
10,000 waypoints, over and over, to waypoint_updater.  I understand
from the Slack channel that this single change (40 Hz to 1 Hz) made a 
huge difference in performance.

waypoint_updater/launch/waypoint_updater.launch:
Set output mode to "screen".

waypoint_updater/waypoint_updater.py:
Lots of changes.  The main task of waypoint_updater is to
store a copy of the waypoints, and then every time the pose
changes, publish a list of the 200 waypoints that are just
ahead of the car.  So in principle, every time we get a new
pose, we need to search through all 10,000 waypoints to find
the nearest one.  But in practice, the car doesn't move too
far between pose messages, so we really only need to search
waypoints near the waypoint found in the previous call.

How to run:

(These instructions are similar to, but slightly different from,
the generic Udacity instructions in CarND-Capstone/README.md)

Clone the repository 
cd to the repository directory (CarND-Capstone)

If you haven't already done so, pip install -r requirements.txt

cd ros/src

rm CMakefile.txt (if there is one)
catkin_init_workspace

(the previous two steps are not in the generic Udacity README.md
file, but you need them for my version of the repository)

cd ..

(you should now be in the CarND-Capstone/ros directory)

catkin_make

If no errors, then

source devel/setup.bash
roslaunch launch/styx.launch

Start your simulator (it will NOT start automatically), 
and MAKE SURE to uncheck the "Manual" box!

More changes (2017-09-11 by cs4nd13, tagged cs_v1.0)

Modified dbw_node.py to remove the "steering angle" message.

Changes (2017-09-20 by cs4nd13, tagged cs_v1.1)

Merged in Udacity's latest changes.  Took Udacity's version
(completely replacing my own) for waypoint_loader.py and
waypoint_loader.launch, because Udacity fixed the problem
in the wp_yaw_const.txt. 

Modified dbw_node.py to remove the multiplier I had put on 
steer_ratio, because Udacity has fixed dbw_sim.launch to
have the correct value.

Changes (2017-09-20 by cs4nd13, tagged cs_v1.2)

Added some efficiency fixes that I've been working on.

server.py: send a dbw_enabled message when the connections
is first made, so that we know the initial status of dbw.
Also: Experiments showed that on my machine, at least,
the simulator's throttle was sporadically going to zero 
(as shown by "control" messages, as well as by fluctuating 
AccN values in the simulator).  The fix is to send the 
simulator all 3 control messages at once, with throttle 
as the third.

styx server.launch: Send output to screen.

dbw_node.py: Increase max_lat_accel into YawController so 
that we can take curves better at high speed.  Also, 
experiments showed that at high speed, the steering_ratio
needs to be multiplied by 1.2.  This doesn't seem to cause
any problems at low speed.

pure_pursuit_core.cpp: Turn a warning into an error message, 
so that it is more visible.

waypoint_updater.py: At the end of the track, provide waypoints 
from the beginning of the track to complete the loop.  Changed 
some parameters to allow high-speed driving.

Changes (2017-09-24 by ortizjuan2)

dbw_node.py: fixed bug in setting DBWNode.dbw.  Added PID module
to control car's velocity, based on velocity suggestions from
the twist_cmd topic.

Changes (2017-09-24 and 2017-09-25 by cs4nd13)

tl_detector.py: Fixed process_traffic_lights to correctly
handle the case where the car is past the last traffic light
on the track; now looks ahead, past the loop, to the first
traffic light.

waypoint_updater.py: Added new topic, /tl_distance, which provides
the distance to the next red light stop line, in meters.  If no red 
light is detected ahead, then returns -1.0.  This topic is published
at the same frequency as images are received from the car.

Changes (2017-09-24 and 2017-09-27 by calvenn)

tl_detector.py: Comment out line 477 state = light.state. 

tl_cnn.py: add cv2.resize the input image size from 
800x600 to 400x300.  Process image once for every 15 images 
pass by and still can produce tl_distance. 

waypoint_updater.py add dist filter if dist <50: 
self.tl_distance_pub.publish(dist)

Changes (2017-09-27 by cs4nd13)

ros/launch/styx_fast_tl.launch: this is a launch file with 
the traffic_light_algorithm parameter set to 0 so that the 
simulator's traffic-light-state detection is used, instead of 
an image processing algorithm, to determine the traffic light state

tl_detector.py: Moved Calvenn's image processing algorithm out
of this file into files in the sub-directory light_classification_ct.
Imported that sub-directory.
Added a parameter, self.algorithm, which determines which image-processing
algorithm will be called.  So far there are only two choices: 0 means
that the traffic-light-state information from the simulator will be
used; 1 means that Calvenn's algorithm will be used.
Added a parameter, self.max_tl_distance.  If the car is more than this
distance from the next light, do not call the image-processing
algorithm.
Note that important parameters such as algorithm, max_tl_distance, and
skip-frame count, are all set in tl_detector.py, in TLDetector.__init__ .
The algorithm can also be set in the ROS parameter traffic_light_algorithm.

light_classification_ct directory: Moved Calvenn's code and data here.
tl_cnn.py: Changed file paths to point to the new locations of the data.  
Moved frame-skipping logic from here to tl_classifier.py.
tl_classifier.py: Moved Calvenn's code, formerly in tl_detector.py,
to here.  Moved frame-skipping logic to here.

waypoint_updater.py: Undid Calvenn's change, since the max_tl_distance
logic in tl_detector.py handles this now.

Changes (2017-09-29 by cs4nd13)

Merged in latest changes from the Udacity upstream repository.  
The main changes affecting us:

Various unit-conversion bugs in waypoint_loader.py have been fixed.
The units are a bit confusing, because the launch file gives the
desired velocity in km per hour, the simulator displays velocity in 
miles per hour, and internally the code uses meters per second.

requirements.txt has been updated to require version 1.0.0 of
tensorflow.  (Udacity's change actually has a typo, so I have
incorporated a fix from a pull request that Udacity hasn't yet
acted on).

Changes (2017-09-29 by cs4nd13)

Publish distance to next light, even if not red

tl_detector.py: Modified value published in topic /traffic_waypoint.
If wp (the published value) is > 0, then wp is the waypoint of the
next red light.  If wp < 0, then abs(wp) is the waypoint of the next
light, but the next light is not red (or its state is unknown).

waypoint_updater.py: Modified value published in topic /tl_distance.
If tld (the published value) is > 0, then tld is the distance in
meters to the next light, and the next light is red.  If tld < 0,
then abs(tld) is the distance to the next light, and the next
light is not red (or its state is unknown).

Changes (2017-10-01 by cs4nd13)

Merged in Christian's changes:
This classifier is activated when traffic_light_algorithm is set to 2.
More details of this classifier can be found in the repo:
https://github.com/neocsr/traffic-light-detection

Created ros/launch/styx_csr.launch to launch using this algorithm.
